## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this project I started to experiment with modifier classes. I am trying to practice using "best practices" that will scale to larger projects.

```html
<div class="subscription__cta padding-1">
<div class="subscription__cost flex align-center">
```
```css
.align-center {
    align-items: center;
}
.padding-1 {
    padding: 1.8em;
}
.mt-1 {
    margin-top: 2em;
}
```
